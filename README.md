# CKEditor Integration in XWiki

Adds support for editing wiki pages using [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/).

This application extends the Edit menu with a new entry called 'CKEditor' that loads a new edit mode where you can edit the content of the wiki page using the CKEditor. Checkout the [documentation](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CKEditor+Integration) for more details.
